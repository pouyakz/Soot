### What is Call graph?
A call graph (also known as a call multigraph) is a control-flow graph, which represents calling relationships between subroutines in a computer program. Each node represents a procedure and each edge (f, g) indicates that procedure f calls procedure g. Thus, a cycle in the graph indicates recursive procedure calls.

### Usages
Call graphs can be used in different ways. One simple application of call graphs is finding procedures that are never called. Call graphs can act as documentation for humans to understand programs.[6] They can also serve as basis for further analyses, such as an analysis that tracks the flow of values between procedures, or change impact prediction.[7] Call graphs can also be used to detect anomalies of program execution or code injection attacks.
